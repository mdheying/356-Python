        "# Introduction\n",
        "When we report the results of our experiments, we need to also report the uncertainty of the result.  In most cases, you will repeat the same experiment many times so that you can be certain that your results are reproducible.  For numerical results, it is customary to report the average result ± the uncertainty, and it is important to describe how the uncertainty is computed.  A common way to report the uncertainty of an average value is using a 95% (two-tailed) confidence interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this equation, **s** is the sample standard deviation, **t** is Student's t, and **N** is the number of results that you are averaging.  Values for **t** are found in stats and quant books; an abbreviated table of t values at the 95 % confidence level (two-tails) is shown below.\n",
        "\n",
        "A statement might look something like “with an average value of 4.25 ± 0.10 g, with a level of confidence of approximately 95%.”  If you are looking at a [t-test table](https://www.tdistributiontable.com/), the degrees of freedom (DF) are not the same as N, but DF = N-1.  For a more exhaustive treatment of uncertainty reporting, see the NIST guidelines.<sup>1</sup>\n",
